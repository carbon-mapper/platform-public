# Jupyter Notebook Tutorials

### [Tutorials README](tutorials/README.md)

In addition to serving as a public issue tracker for Carbon Mapper platform issues, this repository also provides a
collection of Jupyter Notebook tutorials that serve as introductions to working with the platform API. A good place to
begin is the [scoped token tutorial](tutorials/scoped_token.ipynb), which demonstrates requesting an access token from
the API using account credentials, and also an approach for storing that access token for tutorial use via IPython
storage.
