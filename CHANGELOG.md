# Carbon Mapper - Version Log

Carbon Mapper is committed to continuously improving its scientific algorithms, applying updates to both future and historical data when necessary. This practice, known as “reprocessing,” is a widely used approach in scientific data management that ensures data remain accurate, consistent, and aligned with the latest scientific understanding, algorithms, and calibration standards. Reprocessing ensures consistency across data versions and sources by harmonizing datasets from different missions and instruments. This is crucial for creating seamless time series that support accurate analysis and monitoring of long-term trends.

All updates to Carbon Mapper data are assigned a version number for each product level, with a detailed version log summarizing modifications and documenting the state of the corresponding algorithms. Each version reflects rigorously vetted algorithm improvements to enhance accuracy and reduce observation uncertainty. Our [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://assets.carbonmapper.org/documents/L3_L4%20Algorithm%20Theoretical%20Basis%20Document_formatted_10-24-24.pdf) contains algorithm justification for our most recent algorithms and citations with detailed overviews of our product levels and algorithms associated with each product level. Additional information about each product level can be found in our [Product Guide]( https://carbonmapper.org/articles/product-guide).

We periodically reprocess historical data to ensure that past datasets benefit from the most recent, validated, and 
reliable algorithms. Previous versions of historical data will remain accessible to users who may need them for specific
applications or comparative purposes via [Carbon Mapper’s STAC API](https://api.carbonmapper.org/api/v1/stac). The STAC 
API can be used to retrieve previously published versions of data identified by the version number in the STAC collection name.Each historical reprocessing builds on the strengths of our existing algorithms, further 
enhancing data accuracy and refining precision to provide even more reliable emission estimates.

* The [Summary table](#summary-table) has an overview of published data versions.
* The [Detailed Version Notes](#detailed-version-notes) thoroughly explain how algorithms changed in a specified collection and what instruments and gases are impacted.
* The [FAQ section](#version-log-faq) answers questions about how to use this version log and how to identify what version of a product you are looking at.

#### Emit Case Studies of V3 Changes

<details open><summary> Large Change (emi20240812t213903p14030-A) </summary>

Plume id: [emi20240812t213903p14030-A](https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_1B2_250m_-101.91337_32.21234%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#13.62/32.2185/-101.90175)
![emi_v3_large](./image_folder/emi_v3_large.png)
Change Notes: 
* Close to a 50% reduction in emission rate
* Change is due to the previous mask including an artifact (dark red pixels)
* We have improved our artifact masking on EMIT v3. This allowed us to remove those dark red false enhancements leading to a better mask and more accurate emission.

| **Version** |     **Emission** |                                                            **Concentration** |**Mask**|

Plume id: [emi20240730t095231p07033-A](https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_1B2_250m_52.77433_43.29013%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#13.12/43.30083/52.78972)
![emi_v3_small](./image_folder/emi_v3_small.png)
Change Notes: 
* Decreased 5.8%, this is within the previous uncertainties of this plume
* We have updated how we convert pixel concentrations into emission estimates. This now considers the elevation of the plume which led to a minor change in rate.
* Change is not perceptible to the eye. Do note that we have improved uncertainties so even though our rate changed very little this plume now has larger more accurate uncertainty bounds.

Plume id: [emi20240816t104126p07026-A](https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_6A_500m_28.14771_41.21533%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#13.12/41.21211/28.15728)

![emi_v3_small_wind](./image_folder/emi_v3_small_wind.png)
Change Notes: 
* Increased 12.6%, this is within the previous uncertainties of this plume
* Concentrations and masking have remained relatively consistent. Change is caused by winds increasing from 5.15m/s to 6.19m/s.
* We now use a consistent and thoroughly tested wind product for global emissions. This wind change is part of the updated uncertainties which again have increased to be more realistic for this plume.

These algorithms enable us to translate emissions detections from various remote sensing instruments (satellite or airborne tools) into the plumes that you see on our portal and the associated information associated with them (including the source emission rate).
    
    In short, these algorithms allow Carbon Mapper to turn the complex information delivered by observing instruments into actionable emissions data and insights.

1. **Why do you conduct an update of your algorithms and reprocessing?** <details><summary>(Click to expand)</summary>

    Carbon Mapper continues to refine algorithms as more controlled release experiments are performed. Any modifications to Carbon Mapper algorithms from product levels 2 through 4 (L2–L4) are only undertaken when they significantly improve correlation and bias against controlled validation datasets and other independent benchmarks (e.g., cross-comparison with other instrument platforms).
    
    As Carbon Mapper acquires and quantifies more data across regions, sectors, topographies, surfaces, and environmental conditions, we continue to improve the science and algorithms behind our emissions data. Our ongoing validation work includes controlled release experiments, under-flights, and instrument and satellite inter-comparisons. Together, these efforts ensure all our data remain accurate, consistent, and scientifically robust — enabling users to confidently assess trends in data over time.
    
    Reprocessing Carbon Mapper’s historical data ensures that past datasets benefit from the most recent, validated, and reliable algorithms, further enhancing data accuracy and emission estimates. Reprocessing is a best practice in scientific data management that ensures data remains accurate, consistent, and aligned with the latest standards — enabling users to confidently assess trends in data over time.

1. **Are older versions of data considered less accurate than newer versions?** <details><summary>(Click to expand)</summary>
     We periodically reprocess historical data to ensure that past datasets benefit from the most recent, validated, and reliable algorithms. Each historical reprocessing builds on the strengths of our existing algorithms, further enhancing data accuracy and refining precision to provide even more reliable emission estimates.

1. **How can I tell what version of data I am looking at?** <details><summary>(Click to expand)</summary>
    From the portal:
    ![example_version_portal](image_folder/example_version_portal.png)
    
    From the STAC API (https://api.carbonmapper.org/api/v1/stac):
    * Find the version in the properties of each STAC item.  For example:
    
    ```
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      ...
      "properties": {
        ...
        "version": "v2"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    From CSV downloads
    ```
    plume_id,                      ...,  emission_version,  ...
    tan20250130t140224c00s4001-A,  ...,  v1,                ...
    ```

1. **How do I know if algorithmic changes from one version to another impact the data I am looking at?** <details><summary> (Click to expand)</summary>
    Note the version number of your data and find the corresponding section in this Version Log.  Within this section, note changes described for data grouped by product level (eg, “L3”, “L4”), instrument (eg, “EMIT”, “Tanager”), gas, etc. to identify changes to your specific data.  If your data have no changes described for the given version, then they are not impacted.
    </details>

1. **What does the version mean?  Why would it change?**<details><summary>(Click to expand)</summary>

    Carbon Mapper works continuously to improve its algorithms for detecting and quantifying greenhouse gas emissions.  When an improvement is made and we begin using it to generate new data published on our portal, we will change the version number in the data to indicate that and to distinguish it from data generated with previous algorithms.
    </details>

1. **How much does reprocessing change the data and what kinds of changes are expected?** <details><summary> (Click to expand)</summary>
    These improvements represent a refinement of our processes and data, not a wholesale change. A majority of plumes are minorly changed, while a small minority are impacted due to the cumulative effect of several algorithm updates. We anticipate that less than 5% of plumes will be changed significantly (statistically relevant). Reprocessing is likely to result in a more accurate and robustly quantified emission rate that has been validated with controlled datasets and assessed against other independent benchmarks.
    
    Reprocessing allows plumes to be more accurately intercompared temporally and spatially. These algorithm refinements better account for detection and quantification elements such as geography, elevation, windspeed, and plume masking methodology. Some specific updates include the following:
    * We have adopted a consistent wind dataset for plumes outside the US. This dataset agrees closely with gold standard U.S. wind data products, allowing for accurate intercomparison of plumes globally.
      * Plume masking (separating plumes from backgrounds) is more sensitive to local plume conditions and provides more precision details.
      * Elevation and atmospheric conditions for each plume are now queried to more accurately quantify the amount of methane present.
    
    These elements provide more robust detail about each plume detection allowing us to better represent the specific uncertainties for each emission rate. 
    
    During reprocessing, all statistical outliers are manually re-assessed to ensure the newest algorithms are providing reasonable emission rates and behaving as expected. Minimal changes to plumes ensures accuracy while improving uncertainties and enabling more reliable intercomparisons — both temporally and spatially.

1. **How frequently are new versions published?  Will I know in advance?** <details><summary>(Click to expand)</summary>
    In the interest of providing the best data we can, Carbon Mapper may begin publishing new versions of data at any time without prior notice.  When a new version is published, only new data will have the new version.  Prior (historical) data generated with a previous version will remain unchanged.
  
    Carbon Mapper will annually assess the need for, and if necessary, perform a historical data reprocess during the third quarter of each year. Such reprocessing will be announced in advance in this Version Log and other public communications.
  
    </details>

1. **Will “historical data” – prior to reprocessing – always be made available for comparison purposes? If so, how do I find a specific/fixed version of the data?** <details><summary>(Click to expand)</summary>

    Previous versions of historical data that have passed quality control checks will remain accessible to users who may need them for specific applications or comparative purposes.
    
    Carbon Mapper’s data portal (https://data.carbonmapper.org) always displays the most recent versions of the data.
    
    Carbon Mapper’s STAC API (https://api.carbonmapper.org/api/v1/stac) can be used to retrieve previously published versions of data identified by the version number in the STAC collection name.
    * See our [STAC Search tutorial](./tutorials/stac/search_l4a_ch4_emission.ipynb) for an example of using the STAC api.
      * See below for an example of modifying the above tutorial to search for V1 data: 
         * Modify the collection id to specify v1 (`"collections": "l4a-ch4-mfa-v1"` ) - the modified query parameters would look like:
    ```python
    
    parameters = {
        "max_items": 10,  # Limit results for tutorial
        "datetime": (
            datetime.strptime("20230101", "%Y%m%d"),  # Inclusive start
            datetime.strptime("20240101", "%Y%m%d"),  # Exclusive end
        ),
        "query": {"cm:emission": {"gt": 3000}},  # Emissions greater than 3000 kg/hr
        "collections": "l4a-ch4-mfa-v1",
    }
    search = catalog.search(**parameters)
    ```
